  - Circular Queue
  - Priority Queue
- **Hash Tables**
- **Trees**
  - Binary Trees
  - Binary Search Trees
- **Heaps**
  - Min Heap
  - Max Heap
- **Graphs**
  - Adjacency List
  - Adjacency Matrix

## Algorithms

The repository covers a wide range of algorithms, including:

### Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
